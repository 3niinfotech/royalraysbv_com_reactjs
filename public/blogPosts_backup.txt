Admired for their brilliance, rarity, and timeless elegance, natural diamonds have been the centerpiece of luxury and romance for centuries. But beyond their sparkle lies a story that spans billions of years, one of geological marvels, extreme conditions, and unparalleled beauty.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we&rsquo;ll explore what natural diamonds truly are, how they form deep within the Earth, their distinct properties, and why choosing to <strong>buy natural diamond </strong>from a trusted name like <strong>Royal Rays BV</strong> ensures quality, authenticity, and peace of mind.</p><p><strong>What Is a Natural Diamond?</strong></p><p>A <strong>natural diamond</strong> is a crystalline form of pure carbon, formed under intense pressure and temperature over billions of years deep beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike synthetic or lab-grown diamonds, <strong>natural diamonds</strong> are created by geological processes that occur naturally over vast time periods.</p><p>Each natural diamond is a unique creation of nature, shaped by its own journey through the Earth&rsquo;s mantle. From engagement rings to high-value collectibles, these rare gems hold unmatched value due to their natural origin, durability, and brilliance.</p><p><strong>The Origin of Natural Diamonds</strong></p><p>The story of a natural diamond begins 100-200 kilometers below the Earth&rsquo;s surface in the mantle. Here, at depths where temperatures soar above 1,000&deg;C and pressures exceed 45,000 times atmospheric pressure, carbon atoms bond together to form the remarkable crystal structure of diamond.</p><p>These diamonds are brought closer to the surface through deep-source volcanic eruptions that form kimberlite and lamproite pipes, natural carriers of diamonds to the Earth's crust. Most natural diamonds that we see today were formed 1 to 3.5 billion years ago, making them older than most forms of life on Earth.</p><p><strong>How Are Natural Diamonds Formed?</strong></p><p>The formation of a <strong>natural diamond</strong> is a perfect combination of time, pressure, heat, and carbon. Here&rsquo;s how it happens:</p><ol><li><strong>Carbon Source</strong>: Natural diamonds form from carbon sources deep within the Earth.</li><li><strong>Extreme Heat and Pressure</strong>: At depths over 140 kilometers, carbon atoms are subjected to extreme temperatures and pressures, allowing them to crystallize.</li><li><strong>Crystallization Process</strong>: Over millions of years, these carbon atoms align into a perfect lattice structure.</li><li><strong>Volcanic Eruption</strong>: Deep-source volcanic activity pushes these crystals through the Earth's crust, embedding them in kimberlite rocks.</li></ol><p>Only a small percentage of these volcanic eruptions carry diamonds, which is why <strong>natural diamonds</strong> are incredibly rare and valuable.</p><p><strong>Properties of Natural Diamonds</strong></p><p>Natural diamonds are not just beautiful, they&rsquo;re scientifically remarkable. Some of the key properties include:</p><ul><li><strong>Hardness</strong>: Natural diamonds are the hardest natural substance on Earth (10 on the Mohs scale).</li><li><strong>Thermal Conductivity</strong>: Excellent heat conductor, making them useful in industrial applications.</li><li><strong>Luster</strong>: Unique &ldquo;adamantine&rdquo; luster gives natural diamonds their signature brilliance.</li><li><strong>Refractive Index</strong>: Their ability to bend light enhances sparkle and fire.</li><li><strong>Chemical Composition</strong>: Composed entirely of carbon with a unique atomic structure.</li></ul><p>These characteristics not only make <strong>natural diamonds</strong> desirable for jewelry but also incredibly useful in scientific and industrial fields.</p><p><strong>Why Choose Natural Diamonds Over Lab-Grown?</strong></p><p>While lab-grown diamonds are becoming more common, they lack the natural history, rarity, and emotional value of <strong>natural diamonds</strong>. Here&rsquo;s why natural diamonds are still the preferred choice:</p><ul><li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: Each natural diamond has a unique fingerprint of nature.</li><li><strong>Value Retention</strong>: Natural diamonds hold their value better over time.</li><li><strong>Emotional Significance</strong>: The ancient, natural origin adds depth to the meaning of gifting or wearing one.</li><li><strong>Environmental Uniqueness</strong>: No two natural diamonds are exactly alike, unlike mass-produced synthetic ones.</li></ul><p><strong>Buy Natural Diamond from Royal Rays BV</strong></p><p><strong>Royal Rays BV</strong> is one of the most trusted and reputed names when it comes to sourcing certified, conflict-free, and ethically sourced <strong>natural diamonds</strong>.

A well-cut diamond maximizes brilliance.</li><li><strong>Colour</strong>: Ranges from D (colourless) to Z (light yellow).
